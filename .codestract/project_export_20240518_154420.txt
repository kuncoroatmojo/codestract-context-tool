# **Codestract** â€” Codebase Context Extraction for LLMs

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-image.gif" alt="codestract-main" width="1280"/>
</div>
<br>

Codestract is a powerful command-line tool designed to extract and consolidate text-based files from your codebase into a single context file. This tool is particularly useful for developers working with Large Language Models (LLMs), as it allows them to efficiently prepare their codebase for analysis or fine-tuning by the LLM.

## Features

- **Recursive Directory Traversal**: Codestract can traverse through all subdirectories within a specified directory, ensuring that no file is left behind.
- **File Exclusion**: Automatically excludes certain files like `main.py` and output files from processing, allowing you to customize the exclusion list.
- **Image File Filtering**: Filters out files with image extensions such as `.jpg`, `.png`, etc., to focus solely on text-based files.
- **Timestamp-based Output Files**: Each time the script is run, a new output file with a timestamp is generated and saved in the `context-out` folder, ensuring that your context files are organized and easy to reference.
- **Project Structure Summary**: Codestract generates a summary of the project structure, including directories and files, and inserts it at the top of each exported context file.
- **Encoding Support**: The script supports different file encodings, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of files.
- **Command-line Arguments and Configuration**: Codestract can be customized through command-line arguments and configuration files, allowing you to specify various options such as the directory, output directory, excluded files, file encoding, and logging settings.
- **Logging**: The script provides detailed logging to both the console and a log file, making it easier to monitor and debug the execution process.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Python 3.8+ is required to run the script.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codestract.git
cd codestract
```

### Usage

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal. It will start the process of scanning for files and appending their contents to the specified output file.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You can also pass various command-line arguments to customize the behavior of the script:

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-d DIRECTORY] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-c CONFIG] [-e ENCODING] [--log-file LOG_FILE] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]

Code context exporting script.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        The directory to search for files.
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        The path of the output directory.
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        The path of the configuration file.
  -e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING
                        The encoding to use for reading and writing files.
  --log-file LOG_FILE   The path of the log file.
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        The log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
```

Alternatively, you can create a configuration file and specify its path using the `-c` or `--config` argument.

## Roadmap

Future improvements include:

- **GUI Implementation**: To enhance user interaction and provide a more user-friendly experience.
- **Support for Additional File Types**: Expand the types of files that can be processed, allowing for a more comprehensive codebase context extraction.

# **Codestract** â€” Codebase Context Extraction for LLMs

<br>

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme-image.gif" alt="codestract-main" width="1280"/>
</div>
<br>

Codestract is a powerful command-line tool designed to extract and consolidate text-based files from your codebase into a single context file. This tool is particularly useful for developers working with Large Language Models (LLMs), as it allows them to efficiently prepare their codebase for analysis or fine-tuning by the LLM.

## Features

- **Recursive Directory Traversal**: Codestract can traverse through all subdirectories within a specified directory, ensuring that no file is left behind.
- **File Exclusion**: Automatically excludes certain files like `main.py` and output files from processing, allowing you to customize the exclusion list.
- **Image File Filtering**: Filters out files with image extensions such as `.jpg`, `.png`, etc., to focus solely on text-based files.
- **Timestamp-based Output Files**: Each time the script is run, a new output file with a timestamp is generated and saved in the `context-out` folder, ensuring that your context files are organized and easy to reference.
- **Project Structure Summary**: Codestract generates a summary of the project structure, including directories and files, and inserts it at the top of each exported context file.
- **Encoding Support**: The script supports different file encodings, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of files.
- **Command-line Arguments and Configuration**: Codestract can be customized through command-line arguments and configuration files, allowing you to specify various options such as the directory, output directory, excluded files, file encoding, and logging settings.
- **Logging**: The script provides detailed logging to both the console and a log file, making it easier to monitor and debug the execution process.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Python 3.8+ is required to run the script.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codestract.git
cd codestract
```

### Usage

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal. It will start the process of scanning for files and appending their contents to the specified output file.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You can also pass various command-line arguments to customize the behavior of the script:

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-d DIRECTORY] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-c CONFIG] [-e ENCODING] [--log-file LOG_FILE] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]

Code context exporting script.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY
                        The directory to search for files.
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        The path of the output directory.
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        The path of the configuration file.
  -e ENCODING, --encoding ENCODING
                        The encoding to use for reading and writing files.
  --log-file LOG_FILE   The path of the log file.
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        The log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
```

Alternatively, you can create a configuration file and specify its path using the `-c` or `--config` argument.

## Roadmap

Future improvements include:

- **GUI Implementation**: To enhance user interaction and provide a more user-friendly experience.
- **Support for Additional File Types**: Expand the types of files that can be processed, allowing for a more comprehensive codebase context extraction.

<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

# File: ./.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample

#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.
